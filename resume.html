            I learned to use the following software: Visual Studio, WebStorm, PyCharm, Git. </p>

                Using C# with .NET MAUI, I developed a mobile note-taking app which integrated SQLite and a feature using an API.
                To ensure app functioned correctly, I MSTest to create automated tests and did extensive manual testing.
                Using Python, I refactored a tic-tac-toe game so that it was modularised and included unittest testing.
                I designed and implemented a simplified car park system using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
                I also contributed to an open-source project on GitHub.
                In terms of web development, I created this personal portfolio website which incorporates Tailwind CSS.
                My favourite parts of this course were definitely using Python and building my own portfolio website.

                how to plan and create digital games and animations, in both 2D and 3D.
                I learned the following software: Unreal Engine, Substance Painter, Photoshop, Maya and After Effects. </p>
            <p class="hidden text-white p-[2vw] text-[clamp(8px, 2vw, 15px)]">
                I learnt about writing a game design document, creating game proposals, prototypes and white-boxing.
                I got multiple opportunities to do storyboarding, concept art and character design.
                My 3D character design included initial sketches, followed by modelling, rigging and finally a walk-cycle and run-cycle.
                I created 2 30s 2D animations all they way from thumbnails, storyboard, animatic to completion, including voice acting.
                I made a 3D level design and implemented it in Unreal Engine, using Blueprints to turn it into a playable level.
                In a team, we built a 3D animated 30s animation using all our own 3D models and assets. My role also included team management and task allocation.
                In my illustration classes, I was introduced to perspective drawing and created two-point and three-point perspective drawings.
                I built a cyberpunk themed room as a floor plan and brought it to life as a 3/4 perspective.
                I delved into character design, creating character sheets and outfit design, and then an illustration of a rap battle scene.
